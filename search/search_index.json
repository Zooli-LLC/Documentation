We highly recommend keeping entirely separate apps specifically for your Quickbooks data vs. building the integration into apps you are already using for another purpose. This keeps data properly segregated for this purpose and also gives you the option to feed information from multiple workspaces into your Quickbooks apps.\u00a0</p> <p>For creating Quickbooks Invoices, you will need 2 apps:\u00a0Customers\u00a0and\u00a0Invoices, with an optional third\u00a0Line Items\u00a0app.\u00a0</p> <p>Customers App</p> <p>The Customers app needs at minimum 2 fields: Customer Name and Customer ID. The Customer ID is the Quickbooks ID for the customer. If you have existing customer in your Quickbooks Online account, you can export that list to Excel and then import it into this app.</p> <p>Invoices App</p> <p>The Invoices app also needs at minimum 2 fields: A Relationship field to the Customers app, and Invoice Amount. If your invoices will have custom line items (i.e. if the invoices won't always have the same singular line item), then you will also need a Relationship field to a Line Items app, explained below.</p> <p>Line Items App (optional)</p> <p>The Line Items app needs 2 fields: Line Item Name and Quickbooks ID. These are classified as Items in Quickbooks and can be found in the Products and Services section in your account. Similar to Customers, if you have existing items in Quickbooks Online then you can export that list an import them into this app.</p> <p>Step 2: Create an app from your Intuit Developer account</p> <p>Log in to your\u00a0Intuit Developer Account\u00a0and\u00a0select \"My Apps\" at the top. Follow the steps to create an app for Quickbooks Online and Payments. You can name the app whatever you like, and select Accounting for the scope.\u00a0</p> <p>Once the app is created, navigate to the \"Keys &amp; OAuth\" section under Production. You may also start by developing in the Development environment if this is your first time setting up this integration.\u00a0</p> <p>In the Production environment, you will see that you need to complete some additional setup information. Once this is done, you will see the Keys &amp; OAuth information for your new app which is used in the next step.\u00a0</p> <p>In the Redirect URIs section, select \"Add URI\" and add\u00a0https://procfu.com/authenticate.php.</p> <p>Step 3: Set up API Configuration in ProcFu</p> <p>ProcFu is what will allow Podio to communicate with Quickbooks Online's developer API. To begin this setup, log in to ProcFu and go to Menu -&gt; Configuration. In the upper right, click the \"Add API\" link. Fill out the next page with the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Service Name:\u00a0Your choice. We usually use \"quickbooks_production\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Client ID:\u00a0Client ID from your app created in Step 1</p> </li> <li> <p>Client Secret:\u00a0Client Secret from your app created in Step 1</p> </li> <li> <p>Authorize URL: https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2</p> </li> <li> <p>Scopes:\u00a0com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting</p> </li> <li> <p>Access Token URL: https://oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource Owner Details URL: https://accounts.platform.intuit.com/v1/openid_connect/userinfo</p> </li> <li> <p>Redirect Success URL:\u00a0Your choice. We usually use the Podio workspace URL.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redirect Failure URL:\u00a0Same as above</p> </li> </ul> <p>Step 4: Building your Podio Workflow Automation flows</p> <p>Authenticating for the first time</p> <p>You will need to set up a flow using the\u00a0[API Get Login Link ProcFu script]{.underline}. The API Service parameter is the Service Name from Step 3 and the User ID is the email address for your ProcFu account. The response for this call is an OAuth login link - we recommend setting up a Task as part of this flow containing the login link, then run the flow once to receive the link.</p> <p>Creating Customers</p> <p>This flow will live in your Customers app. We recommend setting this as a Manual flow so that you can set up multiple triggers to create customers. Create a custom variable which contains the payload to be sent to Quickbooks. A simple example payload:</p> <pre><code>foo();function foo(){\n    return json_encode([\n        \"DisplayName\" =&gt; {Contact Name},\n        \"PrimaryEmailAddr\" =&gt; [\n            \"Address\" =&gt; {Contact Email}\n        ]\n    ]);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Send this payload using\u00a0ProcFu's Make API Request script.

This app will act as the instruction list for your follow ups. This will be structured in a way that allows you to store multiple campaigns or schedules, and you can also set multiple follow up types (Email\u00a0and\u00a0SMS\u00a0are included here -\u00a0Ringless Voicemail\u00a0via SlyBroadcast is also an option but requires some additional setup).</p> <p>The Follow Up Schedule App requires the following fields:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Title:\u00a0Calculation field combining\u00a0Schedule\u00a0and\u00a0Sequence\u00a0below. Note you will need to save your app with the below fields before you can add this field.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Schedule:\u00a0Category field with options for each different schedule you would like to include</p> </li> <li> <p>Sequence:\u00a0Number field noting the order of each follow up in the schedule</p> </li> <li> <p># Days to Go Out:\u00a0Number field noting how many days the follow up should go out after the follow up schedule starts</p> </li> <li> <p>Email Subject: Text (Single Line) for the email subject</p> </li> <li> <p>SMS or Email Body: Text (Multi Line) for the body of the SMS or email</p> </li> </ul> <p>Add an item to this app for each instance of your follow up schedules. Make sure your \"# Days to Go Out\" is always increasing with each number in the sequence, otherwise your flow will eventually get stuck as a follow up would be scheduled in the past.</p> <p>Prepping your Podio App</p> <p>Next, you will need to add a few fields to the Podio app that contains your contacts for these follow ups. This could be your Leads or Contacts app, or any other app that stores this type of information.</p> <p>Consider adding a\u00a0section header\u00a0to this area in your app to visually separate these fields from the rest of your app.</p> <p>Your app will need the following fields:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Follow Up Schedule:\u00a0Category field with options for each schedule, matching the schedules in your Follow Up Schedule app. This field is used to activate the selected schedule.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow Up Start Date: Date field (autofilled via Podio Workflow Automation)</p> </li> <li> <p>Next Follow Up Date:\u00a0Date field (autofilled via Podio Workflow Automation)</p> </li> <li> <p>Next Follow Up:\u00a0Relationship field pointing to the Follow Up Schedule app (autofilled via Podio Workflow Automation)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Building the Flows</p> <p>Now you are ready to set up your automations.</p> <p>Flow 1: Starting the Schedule</p> <p>The first flow will trigger when your \"Follow Up Schedule\" field is updated on a lead. This will begin your follow up Schedule.</p> <p>The flow will need to locate the first sequence in the selected follow up schedule. Build a search_string variable and set it to \"{sequence_name} . \" \" . 1\"</p> <p></p> <p>Next, add a Search action and search your Follow Up Schedules app for an item whose Title matches your search_string variable. If a matching item is found, update your current item with the information on the located follow up. You will fill in the\u00a0Follow Up Start Date,\u00a0Next Follow Up Date\u00a0(adding the # Days to Go Out field to the current date), and the\u00a0Next Follow Up\u00a0item.</p> <p></p> <p>Performing the Follow Up Actions</p> <p>Now that your follow ups are scheduled, it's time to build flows to send out your follow ups on the scheduled dates. This flow will trigger \"By an Item's Date Field\", when\u00a0Next Follow Up Date\u00a0is equal to the current date. Be sure to adjust the trigger time to a reasonable time in your time zone, so that you aren't messaging your contacts in the middle of the night.</p> <p>The first step in the flow will be a\u00a0Get Referenced Items\u00a0action that gets the Follow Up item via the \"Next Follow Up\" field.</p> <p>You will need two sections to this flow - one for follow ups that are of type \"SMS,\" and another for follow ups that are of type \"Email\". Use Sanity Checks for each of these sections.</p> <p>For\u00a0Email\u00a0follow ups, perform a Send Email action, filling in the Email with the Email Subject and Body from your Follow Up Schedule app.</p> <p>Note:\u00a0If your contact's email address is an\u00a0Email\u00a0field type, you will need to parse out the email address using the variable shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>For\u00a0SMS\u00a0follow ups, use a \"Send SMS\" action, filling in the body with the SMS Body from your Follow Up Schedule app.</p> <p>Note:\u00a0Your \"To\" number must be in format \"+1xxxxxxxxxx\" in order to be sent. See our article on\u00a0formatting phone numbers\u00a0for assistance with this.</p> <p>Once the follow up has been sent, the next follow up will need to be scheduled. To do this, we will need to find the next follow up in our sequence. Create a new sequence variable and set it to the current follow up sequence + 1, then create a search_string variable, setting it to your Schedule Name + Sequence.</p> <p></p> <p>Now do a \"Clear Collected\" items action to forget your current Follow Up, and run a new Search for your Follow Up Schedule app that looks for your new search_string.</p> <p>Lastly, perform an update item on your current item, updating the\u00a0Next Follow Up\u00a0and\u00a0Next Follow Up Date\u00a0based on the located schedule item.</p> <p>That's it! This is a bare bones follow up sequence flow, but there are many other possibilities you can add in to automate even more.

If you would like something more custom for your existing processes, we also offer\u00a0personalized setup assistance\u00a0for a more custom-tailored workspace.</p> <p>If you are still deciding if Podio is the right tool for you, we recommend looking at the structure of the apps here, and then skimming the Podio Workflow Automation section at the bottom to get an idea for how a project will flow from start to finish.</p> <p>Here are the apps used in our template workspace:</p> <p>Projects</p> <p></p> <p>First, we use a\u00a0Projects\u00a0app as the container for all information related to the project, with separate apps for scheduled events such as site surveys and installations. We have chosen to separate these events to help keep things organized yet easily accessible. If you track too many different things all from one app, it can be very difficult to find the information you need, and the app's performance will be degraded as well.</p> <p>The Project app contains section headers to divide up the various aspects of the project.\u00a0</p> <p>A sample project:</p> <p></p> <p>The Project App sections are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Customer Information:\u00a0The customer's contact info and property address for the solar installation</p> </li> <li> <p>Project Details:\u00a0Information about the project such as panel type, number of panels, any special additions, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sales/Finance Information:\u00a0Who sold the deal, how much did the customer pay, and how they are paying for it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Project Stages:\u00a0The sections contains links to the scheduled events for the projects: Permit applications, Site Surveys, Installations, and Inspections. These links can be clicked to view more details on each event.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Database app</p> <p>In addition to linking to separate stage apps, we have also created a\u00a0Database app\u00a0to store the various types of equipment and other information that you will select from the Projects app. This app stores the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inverter models</p> </li> <li> <p>Solar panel models</p> </li> <li> <p>Battery models</p> </li> <li> <p>Finance companies</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can store anything else here as well - just add a new Category field via the\u00a0app template\u00a0to keep everything organized by type.</p> <p>Common Question:\u00a0Why use the Database app instead of adding category fields in Projects for Panels/Inverters/etc?</p> <ul> <li> <p>While Category fields are certainly an option, using a Relationship field is usually the better choice in these cases, as there can be dozens of models for each equipment type. Using category fields for anything that requires more than 20 categories is generally not recommended, as they can slow\u00a0 down your app and also do not allow you to search to easily find the value you need.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additionally, as models are replaced with newer versions, you can keep historical data by marking equipment types as Active or Inactive. Your relationship field in Projects can be set to show only the active equipment:</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Scheduling Apps: Site Surveys, Permits, Installs and Inspections</p> <p>A major benefit to keeping these apps separate is that you will typically have different teams in each respective event type, and this gives a clean and straightforward area for those teams to go to find their scheduled events.</p> <p>Team members can use\u00a0filters\u00a0to show only the items assigned to them.</p> <p>You can also use the \"Show in calendars\" option to ensure that team members will see their events from their\u00a0Podio calendars.</p> <p></p> <p>Task app</p> <p>This is an optional app to assign tasks to your team members. Some prefer to use\u00a0Podio's built-in task system, but this is meant for quick to-do's and lacks reporting, customization, and collaboration options.</p> <p>The tasks app is linked to the Projects app, and can be\u00a0modified\u00a0to link to any other app as needed. We recommend setting up Workflow Automation flows to create tasks here on certain triggers, such as an install being scheduled or a new project being assigned to a Project Coordinator.</p> <p>Podio Workflow Automation suggestions for template workspace</p> <p>Consider these as a few examples of what is possible in automating your space, but ultimately you decide which flows and processes work the best for your team.</p> <p>Projects</p> <ul> <li> <p>On Project creation,\u00a0assign a Project Coordinator via round robin</p> </li> <li> <p>When a project stage changes to Site Survey, Permit, Install, or Inspection, create a new item in the respective app and link it to the project</p> </li> <li> <p>When a project moves to the Install stage, assign a task to the Project Coordinator to set up an install date and time with the customer</p> </li> <li> <p>When a project moves to the Inspection stage, assign a task to the Project Coordinator to set up an inspection date and time</p> </li> <li> <p>When a project moves to the PTO stage, assign a task to the Project Coordinator to notify the customer</p> </li> <li> <p>If a project has been in the same stage for 2 weeks, create a task for the Project Coordinator to review.
