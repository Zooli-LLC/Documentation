## Workspace Structure

There are three apps at the core of our workspace:

### Contacts  
This is a database of your contacts, where you store basic information like name, email, phone, and any notes pertaining to that contact.

### Leads  
This is where you track information pertaining to your leads. This app is linked to the Contacts app, so each lead is associated with one or more of your contacts. We’ve started the Leads app off with some essential lead information, such as the lead status and lead notes. You can use Tape’s “Customize Fields” option to add, edit, or remove fields to this template.

### Drip Campaigns  
This app tracks the steps in your Drip Campaigns. Add a new item here for each step in your campaigns. The required information for each step is:  

- **Drip Campaign Name:** We’ve added a “Standard” campaign to start. Use the “Customize Fields” option to add more campaigns if needed. Note: If you add a new campaign, be sure to add an identical option to the “Drip Campaign Name” field in the Leads app.  
- **Sequence:** Use this field to order your drip campaign steps, with 1 being the first step. Your campaign steps must follow sequentially without skipping a number. *Pro Tip:* To send more than one follow up at the same time, create multiple steps with the same sequence number.  
- **Type:** Email is the only option by default. If you use an external SMS provider like ClickSend, you can configure your workflow to send via that service as well.  
- **Send after how many days:** Enter the number of days from the start of the campaign that this step should send. Be sure this number is always greater than the step before it.  
- **Email subject:** Only required for emails.  
- **Email or SMS Body:** The contents of what you would like to send out.

## How does it work?

Drip campaigns can be started on any Lead item. To place a lead on a drip campaign, select a campaign via the “Drip Campaign Name” dropdown on the lead, and then select “Start”. The flow will then automatically locate the first step in your selected campaign and begin the campaign.
