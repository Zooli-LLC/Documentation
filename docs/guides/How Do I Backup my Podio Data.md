# 🗂️ How can I back up my Podio data?

Backing up your Podio data is crucial to ensuring that your company's critical information is protected in the event of accidental deletion. Podio does not have a built-in mechanism to recover deleted content, so it is up to each organization to ensure that their data is safely backed up.

We highly recommend using [Momentum Tools Backup & Restore](https://momentumtools.io/?utm_source=zooli) as the simplest way of backing up your Podio workspaces. Backup & Restore will sync your Podio apps to a secured Google Drive folder daily. They also offer a built-in restore function, making it quick and easy to recover data that is deleted. This is a full backup solution that even includes files, comments, and tasks---something that is not offered through Podio's built-in export feature.

If you are not ready for a paid solution, you can also use Podio's [Excel Export](https://docs.sharefile.com/en-us/podio/using-podio/using-apps/exporting-to-excel.html) feature to create regular backups of your Podio apps. This must be done manually for each app. App data that is exported to Excel will **not** include comments, tasks, images, or files attached to the item.

Regardless of the backup solution you choose, it is incredibly important to have a plan in place in the event of data loss---whether via accidental deletion or by a disgruntled employee.

If you have questions about either of these processes, [get in touch with us](https://zooli.io/contact.html) and we can help. We are happy to assist!
